# swiftracer
a path tracer written in swift, step by step

This is an educational project for me to learn better Swift coding practices by creating a path tracer.

I don't really know how a path tracer works, but that's half the fun. 

Please feel free to contact me with suggestions on coding style, errors or just suggestions.
